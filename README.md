# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This webpage was built to help prepare for the bootcamp course. It acts both as a learning mechanism for web development and as a reference for the new material learnt during prework. The main challenges were around GitHub as this was new to me. Making regular changes to the webpage and uploading them to gitHub was a useful learning experience.
